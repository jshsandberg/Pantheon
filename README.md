# Pantheon

An application that allows user's to find friends and compete with them to see which song is the best! 

# Technologies Used

This is a MERN Stack Application while also incorporating the Spotify API. Using the CSSTransition Group to help make the application have a little cleaner UI while still using CSS. 

# Timetable

This application, I have been working on for over four months and the game itself is complete. User's can invite their friend and vote for songs. Want to complete the whole application around July.

# Future Plans

Want to add some cleaner UI components to allow the application to have some pop. Need to add more User information/page that allows the User to look up, past challenges, friends and thier info, and I have more control of their profile (user image ect.)
